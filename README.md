# exif2json

A simple application to extract metadata from any images supported by the [Exiv2](https://exiv2.org/index.html) library into a JSON file.

Requires [Boost.PropertyTree v1.74.0 or later](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/property_tree.html). I did not test it on older libboost version.
